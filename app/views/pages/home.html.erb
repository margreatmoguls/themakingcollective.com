      The journey matters as much to us as the destination.<br/>
      We are not for hire. But you can try to inspire us.

      One of us wanted to learn all the flags of the world.
      He was taken by surprise when his beloved dared him to draw famous flags from scratch.
      Now we have built an iPhone app.
      Itâ€™s different from all the other flag apps.

    <p>
      Flags are weirdly ambiguous.
      Inclusively uniting millions under the same banner, and at the same time excluding billions.
      We are working on a digital art exhibition to invite others to ponder this ambiguity with us.
